    Hi! I'm Charlie Walters, a Neuroscience PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University
    in Baltimore, Maryland. My current research in the lab of Dr. Marshall Hussain Shuler is aimed
    towards understanding <b>how time is represented in the brain</b> in order to <b>make decisions</b>
    about rewarding options that are displaced in time. These time-factoring decisions
    are essential for evolutionary fitness in animals, where time must be allocated efficiently when 
    searching the environment for food or a mate. They are also analagous to human economic decision-making,
    where [].

    I earned my BA in Molecular and Cell Biology at UC Berkeley in Berkeley, California in 2017.
    From 2017-2019, I worked in the lab of Dr. David Foster at UC Berkeley as a research technician
    and lab manager where I designed and built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrode_(biology)">tetrode microdrives</a>
    for neural recording using CAD and 3D printing.
